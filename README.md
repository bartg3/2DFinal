The three significant mechanics we choose to do include a speed power up, double jump, and blaster

For the speed power up:
It is an object within the game that allows players to move at an accelerated
pace which can allow them to dodge easier or progress through the game faster.

For the Double jump:
This mechanic allows the player to jump once more while in the air, increasing
maneuverability throughout the game.

For the blaster:
Its a simple weapon that allows the players to shoot enemies and stun them
to progress throughout the game.
